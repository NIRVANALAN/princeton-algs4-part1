# Balanced Search Trees

## KD-Tree

### 2d tree construction
We alternate using x-coordinate and y-coordinates as key.
- insert further partition the space
- Two applications:
 - find all nodes in a rectangle
 - find nearest neighbor(KNN). As we get closer to the query point, we cut out different parts of the tree as we process.
